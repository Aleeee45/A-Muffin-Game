### Ver. 1.00: 
Added base game
### Ver. 1.10
Added options 1-8 with a timing game to bake the food. KNOWN ISSUE (im too lazy to put it under issues): After selecting option 1-8, the game just ends/exits. ANOTHER KNOWN ISSUE: space between one of the options is blank.
### Ver. 1.25
BUG FIX: Fixed bug with extra "\n" in the options. Also got rid of an extra "e" in the word "these".
